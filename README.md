### Hi 👋 I'm Yi

- 👨‍🎓 I’m a PhD student at the ANU Fenner School of Environment & Society and CSIRO Agriculture and Food
- 👜 I’m working on high-resolution and continental-scale modelling of land surface variables using techniques like data fusion, machine learning and fourier transform
- 📚 I'm interested in remote sensing, soil moisture, and land surface modelling
- 📫 Contact me at: yi.yu1@anu.edu.au

### 🏹 Targets in 2023

- To satisfy the PhD graduation requirements, including:
  - 📖 Manuscript (MS) of LST data fusion to Remote Sensing of Environment (submitted)
  - 📖 MS on Himawari-8 LST calibration (in writing)
  - 📖 MS on soil moisture model averaging (in writing and rescope)
  - 📖 MS on fire-induced changes on energy balance (to be submitted to a special issue of Frontiers in Remote Sensing)
- ✈️ To attend the EGU conference in Vienna, Austria, in April (I'm ready!)
- 📘 To complete the mid-term review as a PhD milestone requested by the School (in June)
