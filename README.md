### Hi 👋 I'm Yi

- 👨‍🎓 I’m a PhD student at ANU Fenner School of Environment & Society and CSIRO Agriculture and Food
- 👜 I’m working on high-resolution and large-scale modelling of land surface variables using techniques like data fusion and machine learning
- 📚 I'm interested in remote sensing, soil moisture, and land surface modelling
- 📫 Contact me at: yi.yu1@anu.edu.au

### 🏹 Targets in 2023

- 📖 Submit a few prepared manuscripts to several targeted journals, including Remote Sensing of Environment, ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Journal of Hydrology, and Science of The Total Environment
- 📖 Attend the EGU conference in Vienna, Austria, in April
- 📘 Complete the mid-term review as a PhD milestone (before June, hopefully)
