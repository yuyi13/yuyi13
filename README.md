### Hi 👋 I'm Yi

- 👨‍🎓 I’m a PhD student at the ANU Fenner School of Environment & Society and CSIRO Agriculture and Food
- 👜 I’m working on high-resolution and large-scale modelling of land surface variables using techniques like data fusion, machine learning and fourier transform
- 📚 I'm interested in remote sensing, soil moisture, and land surface modelling
- 📫 Contact me at: yi.yu1@anu.edu.au

### 🏹 Targets in 2023

- 📖 Submit a manuscript (MS) of LST data fusion to Remote Sensing of Environment (in panel circulation)
- 📖 MS on Himawari-8 LST calibration (data processing almost done)
- 📖 MS on soil moisture model averaging (in writing and rescope)
- 📖 MS on fire induced changes on energy balance (to be submitted to a special issue from Frontiers in Remote Sensing)
- ✈️ Attend the EGU conference in Vienna, Austria, in April (paperwork done)
- 📘 Complete the mid-term review as a PhD milestone requested by the School (will do in June)
